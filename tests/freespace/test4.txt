test 4

Once upon a time, there was a group of animals who wanted to start a band. The rabbit was on the drums, the cat was on the bass guitar, the dog was the lead singer, and the rooster was on the electric guitar.

They practiced for weeks, but no matter how hard they tried, they just couldn't seem to get their act together. Finally, the dog said, "I think we need to bring in a professional to help us out."

So they hired a music teacher, who watched them play and listened to them sing. After a few minutes, she said, "I see what the problem is. You guys are all playing different songs!"

The animals looked at each other in confusion. "What do you mean?" asked the cat.

"Well," said the music teacher, "the rabbit is playing 'Here Comes the Sun,' the cat is playing 'Sweet Home Alabama,' the dog is singing 'Stairway to Heaven,' and the rooster is playing 'Free Bird'!"

The animals burst out laughing. "No wonder it sounds terrible!" said the rabbit.

So they started over, and this time, they all played the same song. And you know what? They sounded pretty good!
